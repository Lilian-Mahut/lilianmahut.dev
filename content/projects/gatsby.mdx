 Gatsby is a modern web framework for blazing fast websites.

###### Go Beyond Static Websites
Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations.
Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

###### Use a Modern Stack for Every Site
No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are built using React and GraphQL.
Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of whether the data is coming from the same backend.

###### Load Data From Anywhere
Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API.
Use source plugins to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.

###### Performance Is Baked In
Ace your performance audits by default.
Gatsby automates code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, and prefetching resources, and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.

###### Host at Scale for Pennies
Gatsby sites don’t require servers so you can host your entire site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site.
Many Gatsby sites can be hosted entirely free on services like GitHub Pages and Netlify.
